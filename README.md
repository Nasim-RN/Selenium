# Selenium
Most projects ideas come from the Udemy course: [Selenium Webdriver with PYTHON from Scratch + Frameworks](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-selenium-automation-in-easy-python-language/)

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the projects I'll be working on during the Selenium WebDriver with Python course! In this repository, I will share the hands-on coding exercises, practice projects, and real-world applications that I create as part of the course's curriculum.

## ðŸ”° Course Overview:

Course Title: Selenium WebDriver with Python

Instructor: Rahul Shetty

Course Provider: Udemy


## ðŸ”° What to Expect

Practical Selenium Automation: I will showcase my progress as I learn to automate web interactions using Selenium WebDriver with Python. You'll find real-world examples of web automation, including website testing, data scraping, and more.

Project Demos: As I complete projects and assignments, I will document and share my work here. You can explore the code, review the implementation, and see how Selenium is used to interact with web applications.

Learning Journey: This repository serves as a record of my learning journey, from the basics of setting up Selenium with Python to advanced techniques and best practices.



## ðŸ”° Why I'm Sharing:

I believe that sharing my projects and code is a great way to not only demonstrate my skills but also to contribute to the Selenium WebDriver with Python community. By making my work public, I hope to inspire, collaborate with fellow learners, and receive feedback to improve my coding skills.


## ðŸ”° Get Involved::

Feel free to explore the projects, ask questions, or offer suggestions. If you're also learning Selenium WebDriver with Python or have experience to share, your contributions and feedback are greatly appreciated. Let's learn and grow together!
